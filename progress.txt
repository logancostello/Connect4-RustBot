This file is to track the progress of the solver throughout its many iterations

Entries will be recorded in the following format:
test_filename: accuracy (%), avg time to solve (sec), avg number of positions searched

If the entry is n/a, then it the current version takes too long to solve those positions in a reasonable amount of time.
(A reasonable amount of time is a few seconds max)

Every time entry is on my M1 MacBook Air with 16gb of RAM. Additionally, my computer is charging for these tests.
